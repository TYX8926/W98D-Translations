0:00:52.199,0:00:53.699

0:00:54.483,0:00:56.483

0:00:56.483,0:00:57.983

0:00:57.983,0:00:59.483
95: You guys forgot!

NT 4: Ouch.

0:01:00.983,0:01:03.483
3.1: We should prepare something, then.

0:01:03.483,0:01:04.983
95: Of course!

0:01:04.983,0:01:06.983
3.1: We first need ideas, though.

0:01:06.983,0:01:08.983
NT 4: How about a party?

0:01:08.983,0:01:10.483
95: That sounds good!

0:01:10.483,0:01:12.483
NT 4: But where do we go?

0:01:12.483,0:01:13.983
3.1: Hmm...

0:01:13.983,0:01:15.983
3.1: What about Kernel?

0:01:15.983,0:01:17.483
95: Oh, right!

0:01:17.483,0:01:19.483
95: I didn't think about that.

0:01:19.483,0:01:21.483
95: What do you guys think?

0:01:21.483,0:01:23.483
NT 4: Yeah!
2.0: Definitely.
3.1: Sounds good to me!

0:01:23.483,0:01:24.983
95: Alright!

0:01:24.983,0:01:26.983
95: Let's go tell the others first.

0:01:38.750,0:01:40.250
2000: Hey, just came back.

0:01:40.250,0:01:42.250
2000: Woah, what's all of this?

0:01:42.250,0:01:44.250
XP: Just trying to build something.

0:01:44.250,0:01:46.250

0:01:46.250,0:01:47.750
XP: Yep!

0:01:47.750,0:01:49.250
2000: That's amazing.

0:01:49.250,0:01:51.250

0:01:51.250,0:01:52.750
XP: Of course!

0:01:52.750,0:01:54.250
2000: Great!

0:01:54.250,0:01:56.750
2000: Also, we haven't checked on 98 for days.

0:01:56.750,0:01:58.250
XP: Oh, right.

0:01:58.250,0:02:00.250
2000: Let's go check on him today.

0:02:00.250,0:02:02.750
XP: Can we invite him over here later?

0:02:02.750,0:02:04.750
XP: I need help building the PC.

0:02:04.750,0:02:06.750
2000: He might still be sick.

0:02:06.750,0:02:09.250
2000: We'll take him to the hospital if he still is.

0:02:09.250,0:02:10.750
XP: Alright.

0:02:27.916,0:02:29.416
XP: Now, we wait.

0:02:34.916,0:02:36.916
2000: You haven't bought it yet?

0:02:36.916,0:02:38.416
XP: Nope.

0:02:38.416,0:02:40.916
XP: The store was closed when I went there.

0:02:40.916,0:02:43.416
XP: I went to the store pretty late, so yeah.

0:02:43.416,0:02:44.916
2000: Makes sense.

0:02:47.633,0:02:49.133
2000: Alright, let's go!

0:03:11.816,0:03:13.316
2000: Yep.

0:03:13.316,0:03:15.816
2000: Where are you going to get lunch?

0:03:20.316,0:03:22.316
XP: Alright. I'll be somewhere here!

0:03:22.316,0:03:23.816
2000: See you later!

0:03:40.966,0:03:42.966
98: This is so boring!

0:03:42.966,0:03:45.466
98: Only resting for days...

0:03:46.533,0:03:48.033
98: Oh?

0:03:48.033,0:03:49.533
98: Just a second!

0:03:56.316,0:03:57.816
2000: Hey, 98!

0:03:57.816,0:03:59.316
98: 2000!

0:03:59.316,0:04:01.316

0:04:01.316,0:04:02.816
2000: How's things?

0:04:02.816,0:04:04.816
98: Well, tired. But I'm fine.

0:04:04.816,0:04:07.316
2000: Have you gotten better lately?

0:04:07.316,0:04:09.816
2000: You've been resting for days.

0:04:09.816,0:04:11.316
98: Not really.

0:04:11.316,0:04:13.316
2000: Have you checked with Whistler?

0:04:13.316,0:04:15.816
98: Nope. I should probably go check.

0:04:15.816,0:04:17.816
2000: Let's go check with him.

0:04:17.816,0:04:19.316

0:04:43.033,0:04:44.533
2000: Hey Whistler.

0:04:44.533,0:04:46.533
Whistler: It's been a while.

0:04:46.533,0:04:48.533
Whistler: How have you two been?

0:04:48.533,0:04:51.033
2000: I've been fine. 98 feels ill, though.

0:04:51.033,0:04:53.033
Whistler: For how long?

0:04:53.033,0:04:54.533
98: About a week?

0:04:54.533,0:04:57.033
98: I haven't been to a hospital yet.

0:04:57.033,0:04:58.533
Whistler: Huh.

0:04:58.533,0:05:00.533
Whistler: Have you had this before?

0:05:00.533,0:05:02.033
98: I don't think so.

0:05:02.033,0:05:04.533
98: I don't really know what this is, though.

0:05:04.533,0:05:06.033
Whistler: It's alright.

0:05:06.033,0:05:08.033
Whistler: Let's head to the patient room.

0:05:08.033,0:05:09.533
98: Alright.

0:05:12.066,0:05:13.566
2000: Best of luck!

0:05:13.566,0:05:15.066
98: Thanks!

0:05:15.066,0:05:17.066

2000: Alright. Thanks for the help!

0:05:19.066,0:05:20.566
Whistler: No problem!

0:05:36.199,0:05:38.199

0:05:45.199,0:05:46.699
2000: Seems delicious.

0:05:46.699,0:05:48.699
2000: Although, 98 isn't here.

0:05:48.699,0:05:50.683
XP: Oh yeah, what happened?

0:05:50.683,0:05:52.683
2000: I took him to the hospital.

0:05:52.683,0:05:54.683
2000: He hasn't recovered yet.

0:05:54.683,0:05:56.183

0:05:58.166,0:05:59.666
2000: Yeah.

0:05:59.666,0:06:01.666

XP: What did I tell you!

0:06:08.683,0:06:11.183
2000: No wonder why you got the food there!

0:06:11.183,0:06:13.183
2000: Millenium Store is awesome.

0:06:13.183,0:06:15.166
XP: Can't agree more.

0:06:15.166,0:06:17.166

0:06:17.166,0:06:18.666
XP: You're kidding.

0:06:18.666,0:06:20.166
2000: Haha.

0:06:20.166,0:06:21.666
XP: Two different things!

0:06:21.666,0:06:23.166
2000: Yeah, literally.

0:06:23.166,0:06:25.166
2000: I hope 98 gets to eat this.

0:06:35.716,0:06:37.716
Whistler (On call): Hey, you can come now.

0:06:37.716,0:06:39.716

2000 (On call): How'd it go?

0:06:41.716,0:06:44.716
Whistler (On call): Well, I don't really know what problem it is...

0:06:44.716,0:06:46.716
Whistler (On call): But he seems fine now.

0:06:46.716,0:06:48.216
2000 (On call): Huh.

0:06:48.216,0:06:50.216
2000 (On call): So you're not sure of what's happening?

0:06:50.216,0:06:51.716
Whistler (On call): Yeah, kinda.

0:06:51.716,0:06:54.216
Whistler (On call): But 98 seems fine now.

0:06:54.216,0:06:56.216

0:06:56.216,0:06:58.216

3.1: Yep.

0:08:48.633,0:08:50.633
Chicago: Well, while we're at it...

0:08:50.633,0:08:53.133
Chicago: I've got a game to show you guys.

0:08:53.133,0:08:54.633
3.1: What is it?

0:08:54.633,0:08:56.133
Chicago: It's Pinball.

0:08:56.133,0:08:58.133
95: Don't we already have that game?

0:08:58.133,0:09:00.133
Chicago: Yeah, but I modified it.

0:09:00.133,0:09:01.633
3.1: What's the difference?

0:09:01.633,0:09:03.633
Chicago: It supports 4 players now.

0:09:03.633,0:09:05.633
95: What?!

95: So, how does this work?

0:09:12.133,0:09:13.633
Chicago: Multiplayer is all.

0:09:13.633,0:09:16.133
Chicago: 3.1, can you share your laptop with NT?

0:09:16.133,0:09:17.633
3.1: Sure!

0:09:17.633,0:09:19.633
95: This is something revolutionary.

0:09:19.633,0:09:21.633
95: Only within our realm, though.

0:09:21.633,0:09:23.133
Chicago: Obviously.

0:09:23.133,0:09:25.133
3.1: Let's start the game, then.

0:09:25.133,0:09:27.633
Chicago: Iâ€™ll set it up on your laptops.

0:09:27.633,0:09:29.633
Chicago: Give me a second.

0:09:31.850,0:09:33.350
Chicago: All done!

Chicago: Yep.

0:13:45.550,0:13:48.050
95: We don't have to rush, by the way.

0:13:48.050,0:13:50.050
95: The party's in a week.

0:13:50.050,0:13:52.550
Chicago: So we prepare, then
just have fun.

0:13:52.550,0:13:54.050
95: Pretty much!

0:13:54.050,0:13:56.050
95: I hope they'll like this.

0:13:56.050,0:13:57.550
Chicago: Yeah.

0:13:57.550,0:13:59.550
Chicago: Also, is anyone feeling hungry?

0:13:59.550,0:14:01.550
3.1: I think everyone is, haha.

0:14:01.550,0:14:03.050
95: Agreed.

0:14:03.050,0:14:05.050
Chicago: Let's head to a kiosk later.

0:14:10.550,0:14:12.550
3.1: 5 years, why wouldn't I?

0:14:12.550,0:14:15.050
NT 4: What took them so long, though?

0:14:15.050,0:14:17.050
Chicago: A development reset happened.

0:14:17.050,0:14:19.050
Chicago: I heard it wasn't going well.

0:14:19.050,0:14:21.050

0:14:21.050,0:14:23.550

0:14:23.550,0:14:25.050

0:15:48.166,0:15:50.666

0:15:50.666,0:15:52.166
98: Huh.

0:15:52.166,0:15:54.666
98: I havenâ€™t exercised for a long time.

0:15:54.666,0:15:56.666

XP: If it gets worse, you should go check.

0:15:59.166,0:16:00.666

0:16:22.766,0:16:24.766
2000: Want to stop by the coffeeshop?

0:16:24.766,0:16:26.766

0:17:09.283,0:17:11.283
Longhorn: Thatâ€™d be about 9 dollars.

0:17:11.283,0:17:12.783

0:17:35.733,0:17:37.233

0:18:24.783,0:18:27.283

0:18:37.833,0:18:39.833
98: Where'd they get that name?

0:18:39.833,0:18:41.333
2000: Not sure.

0:18:41.333,0:18:43.833

XP: What about the release date?

0:18:45.833,0:18:48.333
2000: I suspect it'll be in a few months.

0:18:48.333,0:18:50.833

0:18:50.833,0:18:52.833
98: That's exciting.

0:18:52.833,0:18:54.833
