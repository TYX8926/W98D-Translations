## Community translation guidelines
Here are the guidelines for translating.

- You'll need to be fluent in the language you're translating for obvious reasons.
- Don't overexaggerate the dialogues; just follow along the original.
- You may use any translation tools or use it as the base if it helps you, and then work your way correcting it. Please do not submit an auto-translated file.
- Please submit your file as a .sbv file.
