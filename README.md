# Windows 98 Dies - Caption Translations

Welcome! In here are all of the subtitle files for each part of the Windows 98 Dies series. This is primarily for community translations, and the source's subtitle language is English.

If you would like to make contributions by translating the subtitle files to a language you know, feel free to download/clone the repository, or simply download one of the subtitle files. More information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/TYX8926/W98D-Translations/wiki).

## Community translation guidelines
Here are the guidelines for translating.

- You'll need to be fluent in the language you're translating for obvious reasons.
- You may use any translation tools or use it as the base, and then work your way there. Please do not, however, submit an auto-translated file.
- Don't overexaggerate tones or speech; follow along the original dialogues.
